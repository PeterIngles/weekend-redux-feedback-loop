## Authors

This was great practice for React, React-Router and Redux for me. Additionally I used MaterialUI for the first time in this project and really enjoyed the ability to create some dynamic components quickly. Looking forward to practicing with that more in the future.

My github and Linkedin are listed below.

Thanks again for checking out our project!
